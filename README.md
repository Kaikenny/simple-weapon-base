## Goal
During the lifetime of garrysmod many weapon bases consisting of poor quality were created, and it would be a shame to see the same in S&box. The goal is to offer an easy to use yet very configurable weapon base maintained by the community for the community.

* Highly configurable
* Support for custom animations and actions

### Offset Editor ([Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5jRZZDgej8))
The `swb_editor_model` command opens a model editor that can be used to easily calculate offsets needed for running, zooming, and more.
